# Homebrew Formulae

## How do I install these formulae?
Invoke either of the following commands if the formula is hosted at GitHub

```sh
$ brew install quarkusio/tap/<formula>
```

Or

```sh
$ brew tap quarkusio/tap
$ brew install <formula>
```

Invoke the following command if the formula is *not* hosted at GitHub

```sh
brew tap quarkusio/homebrew-tap 
brew install <formula>
```
